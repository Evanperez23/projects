    <p id="text">Crossfit USA started as an idea as small as a garage. Our owner Bill was tired of the normal "Bro split" workouts and wanted
        something more functional. He learned about crossfit and started buying his own equipment. He fell in love with the sport and the grind of it all. It started with 
        him inviting his friends and family over for workouts. Then he thought I should open my own crossfit gym! and he did. That's where crossfit USA was born.
