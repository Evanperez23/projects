            <h6>Why Crossfit?</h6>
            
            <p id = benefits> Crossfit training combines many different fitness styles. In a single session you may be performing 
                Olympic lifts, climbing ropes, flipping tires or doing classic push-ups, pull-ups and body-weight squats.
                If tire flipping and rope climbing sound intimidating, don't worry. Crossfit workouts
                are adaptable to almost any fitness level. All you need is the desire to be challenged.
